# React + Vite

: Development - “Circular Economy Marketplace: Connecting 
Waste to Value” 
 Build a Full-Stack Web/Mobile Application that: 
● Lists available recyclable materials (type, quantity, quality grade, 
location) from generators and recyclers 
● Matches suppliers with buyers using smart algorithms (price, 
location, material type, quality) 
● Tracks material provenance from collection to remanufacturing 
with blockchain-inspired transparency 
● Provides fair market pricing based on real-time demand and 
material specifications 
● Onboards informal waste workers with simplified digital wallets 
and transaction records 
● Includes SMS/WhatsApp notifications for low-connectivity users 
in Tier 3 areas

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
